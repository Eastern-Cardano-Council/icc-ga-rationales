## Summary
We have determined that this budget Info governance action is constitutional.

## Rationale Statement
Article IV, Section 2 of the Cardano Constitution states "Cardano Blockchain budgets shall specify a process for overseeing use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals including designating one or more administrators who shall be responsible for such oversight."

The governance action with ID "e14de8d9dc4f4ddf3fe9250a8a926e20f10e99b86bd0610b77d7a054981591ee#0" and title “Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect”, as a budget Info governance action, designates “Intersect” as the administrator responsible for overseeing the use of funds. It also specifies a process for overseeing the use of funds from the Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals, including a list of “Safeguards” and the use of audited smart contracts with specified capabilities.

We therefore find this governance action **Constitutional**.
