Governance actions should address their expected impact on the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.\"\n\nThe guardrails that require consideration for this governance action are, PCM-01, PCM-02, PCM-03 and PCM-04.  The rationale supplied with this governance action, sufficiently addesses the criteria in these guadrails.\n\nFurther, the rationale provides information regarding the technical review that was performed in relation to this change.  As the cost model parameter change is only enabled with the next hard fork and is something that needs to be optionally used by dapps, we are satisfied with the technical evaluation that was performed.\n\nWe therefore find this governance action **Consitutional**.",
