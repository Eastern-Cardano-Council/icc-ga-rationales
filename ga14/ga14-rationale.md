## Summary
We have determined that this budget Info governance action is constitutional.

## Rationale Statement
Article IV, Section 2 of the Cardano Constitution states "Cardano Blockchain budgets shall specify a process for overseeing use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals including designating one or more administrators who shall be responsible for such oversight."

The governance action with ID “bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26#0” and title “Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget: Amaru Node Development 2025”, as a budget Info governance action, designates the “Amaru maintainer committee” within PRAGMA as the administrator responsible for overseeing the use of funds. It also specifies a process for overseeing the use of funds from the Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals, including the “PRAGMA Maintainer Committee Framework” and the use of an audited smart contract with specified capabilities.

We therefore find this governance action **Constitutional**.
