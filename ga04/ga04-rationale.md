## Summary
We have determined that this governance action is unconstitutional, due to the absence of sufficient rationale to justify the change.
## Rationale Statement
Article III Section 6 Paragraph 1 of the Interim Constitution states "Any governance action submitted to Ada holders for approval shall require a standardized and legible format including a URL and hash linked to documented off-chain content. Sufficient rationale shall be provided to justify the requested change to the Cardano Blockchain."

The anchor URL included on-chain for the governance action with ID "51f495aa23f4b3b3aa90afde4a0e67823bb7ac4ac65f5ffbb138373b863f2f74#0" is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IntersectMBO/governance-actions/refs/heads/main/mainnet/2024-10-21-ppu/metadata.jsonld.  At the time of submission of this vote on-chain, the anchor URL did not return a document with sufficient rationale for the requested change.  Instead returning "404: Not Found".  As this violates Article III Section 6 Paragraph 1 of the Interim Constitution, we find this governance action **Unconstitutional**.
