## Summary
We have determined that this budget Info governance action is unconstitutional.

## Rationale Statement
Article IV, Section 2 of the Cardano Constitution states "Cardano Blockchain budgets shall specify a process for overseeing use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals including designating one or more administrators who shall be responsible for such oversight."

The governance action with ID “defbf15b06092718adf4befeab982e03d2966b9caeef93c19e470549ef75ea49#0” and title “2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 7.5M ₳ for community builders”, as a budget Info governance action, does not designate one or more administrators who shall be responsible for such oversight, nor does it specify a process for overseeing the use of funds from the Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals.

We therefore find this governance action **Unconstitutional**.
