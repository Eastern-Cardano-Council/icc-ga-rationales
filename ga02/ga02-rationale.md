## Summary
We have determined that this Info Action does not meet the criteria deemed necessary for the Constitutional Committee to assess its constitutionality.
## Rationale Statement
Following the same rationale provided for the governance action with ID “15f82a365bdee483a4b03873a40d3829cc88c048ff3703e11bd01dd9e035c916#0” and title “Name the next hard fork HOSKY Hard Fork”, the Interim Constitution does not empower the Constitutional Committee to assess the constitutionality of an “Info” action if it is not gauging the sentiment towards another governance action which can be enacted on-chain.

The governance action with ID “59fd353253eb177e2104e8f23ea4c63e3d32ef95c7865d03e90d3884424dc1db#0” and title “Cardanoの生きがい - Ikigai -” does not gauge sentiment towards a future governance action which can be enacted on-chain.  This governance action therefore does not meet the constitutionality assessment criteria, so we must **Abstain**.
