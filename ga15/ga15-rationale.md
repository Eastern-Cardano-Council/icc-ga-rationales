## Summary
We have determined that this budget Info governance action is unconstitutional.

## Rationale Statement
Article III, Section 5 of the Cardano Constitution states “…all proposed governance actions are expected to follow a standardized and legible format including a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content to the Cardano Blockchain.” and "The content of every on-chain governance action must be identical to the final off-chain version of the proposed action."

The anchor URL included on-chain for the governance action with ID "4840e305563327358cf70dae5015b2df8f8c35cef03f74521d4f117ac17bc384#0" is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theeldermillenial/2025-liquidity-budget/df0b26d8796b19b566008ea9eaa8f17fef2cb6d4/info.jsonld. The hash of the off-chain content at that URL is “97df3a30b767ee5b8e2b9fde824d91d3366985243ed73c06b257c2163f9045db”, whereas the hash included on-chain with the governance action is “791c6f0adc9aa9436623191d920e0648ddec0b7fdee6306cbc32ce90867ac54ad”.

As the hash submitted with the governance action does not match the hash of the off-chain content, it does not fulfil the above criteria for verifying off-chain content.

We therefore find this governance action **Unconstitutional**.

## Precedent Discussion

## Conclusion
This governance action does NOT fulfil the criteria specified in the Cardano Constitution for verifying off-chain content, so is deemed unconstitutional.
