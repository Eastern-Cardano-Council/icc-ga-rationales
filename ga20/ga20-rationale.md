## Summary
We have determined that this budget Info governance action is constitutional.

## Rationale Statement
Article IV, Section 2 of the Cardano Constitution states "Cardano Blockchain budgets shall specify a process for overseeing use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals including designating one or more administrators who shall be responsible for such oversight."

The governance action with ID “gov_action1n5sn54mgf47a7men2ryq6ppx88kta4wvenz2qkl4f9v6ppje8easqxwm88m” and title “Cardano GovTool Budget - 12 months full active maintenance and development”, as a budget Info governance action, designates “Intersect” as the administrator responsible for overseeing the use of funds. It also specifies a process for overseeing the use of funds from the Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals using their smart contract framework.

We therefore find this governance action **Constitutional**.
