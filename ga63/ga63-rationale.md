## Summary
We have determined that this treasury withdrawal governance action is unconstitutional.

## Rationale Statement
Article IV, Section 3 of the Cardano Constitution states "No withdrawals from the Cardano Blockchain treasury shall be permitted unless such withdrawals have been authorized and are being made pursuant to a budget for the Cardano Blockchain that is then in effect as required by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, and which has not been determined by the Constitutional Committee to be unconstitutional."

The governance action with ID “gov_action1r44w54hx553mz0sr4cc07f8tlxzj2sa57l2pt3l9pa2ldw42fc7sq5q3rtn” and title “Withdraw ₳5M for Cardano's Global Listing Expansion - Powered by Snek”, has no corresponding budget Info governance action associated with it.

Therefore we find this governance action **Unconstitutional**.

## Conclusion
