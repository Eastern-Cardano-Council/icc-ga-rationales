    "summary": "The ECC has reviewed this governance action proposing a new version of the Cardano Constitution. While we recognize that the proposal satisfies the formal procedural requirements as defined in the current Constitution, we find that there are significant process-related concerns regarding participatory legitimacy. In light of these tensions—between technical compliance and normative expectations—we have opted to abstain from casting a constitutional determination.",
    "rationaleStatement": "This governance action fulfills the procedural criteria required for constitutional amendments, including:\n\n---\n\n### ARTICLE III, Section 5\n\n*\"In order to promote transparency in the process of on-chain governance, prior to being recorded or enacted on-chain, all proposed governance actions are expected to follow a standardized and legible format including a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content to the Cardano Blockchain. Sufficient rationale shall be provided to justify the requested change to the Cardano Blockchain. The rationale shall include, at a minimum, a title, abstract, reason for the proposal, and relevant supporting materials.*\n\n*The content of every on-chain governance action must be identical to the final off-chain version of the proposed action. [...]*\n\nThis governance action adheres to this requirement by:\n\n* Including a valid IPFS URL and metadata hash;\n\n* Providing a clear rationale, title, abstract, justification, and relevant materials.\n\n---\n\n### ARTICLE VIII, Section 2\n\n*\"Except as otherwise so provided in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, amendments to this Constitution, including to the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, shall be approved by a collective decision-making process, requiring an on-chain governance action by owners of ada satisfying a threshold of no less than 65% of the then active voting stake.\"*\n\nThis governance action technically meets the procedural prerequisites for proposing a constitutional amendment.\n\n---\n\n### Guardrails Clause: NEW-CONSTITUTION-02\n\n*\"If specified, the new Guardrails Script must be consistent with this Constitution\"*\n\nNo changes to the Guardrails Script are proposed. The current script hash remains unchanged and is therefore compliant.\n\n---\n\n### Concerns and Constitutional Ambiguity Note\n\nDespite formal compliance, we acknowledge concerns raised by members of the community relating to the participatory legitimacy and process transparency of this governance action. Specifically:\n\n* **ARTICLE I – Tenet 9** emphasizes fair and impartial treatment of all users, in accordance with the collective desires of the community.\n\n* **ARTICLE III, Section 6** encourages off-chain governance mechanisms to ensure debate and co-creation of governance actions.\n\n* **ARTICLE VIII, Section 1** calls for constitutional amendments to be shaped through forums the Cardano Community deems appropriate.\n\nWhile these articles outline principles for inclusive governance, they are not currently enforceable in a binding procedural manner. The absence of broad-based consultations, structured deliberative forums, or publicly accessible design workshops represents a **gap between constitutional spirit and procedural implementation**.\n\n---\n\n### Rationale for Abstention\n\nGiven this ambiguity and absence of consensus within the ECC voting body; we are unable to offer a definitive assessment of constitutionality at this stage. On one hand, \"CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION v2.0\" meets the **letter of the law** as written in the Constitution. On the other hand, it falls short of the **spirit of participatory governance** that the Constitution aspires to uphold.\n\nRather than rule conclusively for or against, we **Abstain.**",
